# Ansible Tower Play Books
##
## My goal is to use a combination of Ansible Tower, GitHub, and an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS snapshot to teach myself how to:
  - Control Ansible Tower
  - Write YAML syntax
  - Write Ansible Plays
  - Create a fully functional Minecraft Server using only DevOps processes
  - Continue to practice Linux system admin skills

As such, it is likely that this repository will be riddled with errors, and often times not operate, but as I grow, I welcome the input and assistance of others!
